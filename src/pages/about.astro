				<p>
					Hello there! I'm Stefan, a <a title="senior software developer" href="https://lzomedia.com">senior software developer</a> from Romania, now living in the United Kingdom. With over 13 years of experience, I am passionate about <b>building enterprise applications</b>. Nothing excites me more than tackling a client's problem head-on and selecting the best programming language for the job.
				</p>
				<p>
					Challenges are my driving force. Solving a coding problem is like working on a Rubik's Cubeâ€”engaging and stimulating. After long hours of coding, a good puzzle can reinvigorate my mind.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite my love for puzzles, I take my work seriously. Every project is an opportunity to grow as a <b>developer</b>, and I always aim to deliver the best solution. Be it PHP, Python, or any other language, I'm ready for the challenge and eager to showcase my skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you're looking for a dedicated <b>developer</b> ready to dive into your coding problems, look no further. Let's work together on your next project and achieve great results!

			<div class="content">
				<p>
					As a <b>senior backend engineer</b>, I am extremely passionate about using technology for good.
                    I firmly believe that technology has the power to make the world a better place, and I am committed to using my skills to contribute to positive change in society.

				</p>
				<p>
					Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of <b>projects</b>, but the ones that truly excite me are those with a social impact. I enjoy working on projects that aim to solve real-world problems, such as improving access to education or healthcare, reducing carbon emissions, or promoting social justice.
				</p>
				<p>
					I strongly believe that it is our responsibility as technologists to use our <b>skills for good</b>.
                    We have the power to create <b>tools and systems</b> that can transform the lives of people around the world, and we should use that power to make a positive impact.
                    Whether it's building a <b>platform</b> that connects students with mentors, <b>developing software</b> to help farmers increase crop yields, or creating an app that promotes sustainable living, I am always eager to take on <b>projects</b> that make a difference.

				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong believer in collaboration and teamwork. I believe that the best results are achieved when people work together towards a common goal. I enjoy working with other engineers, designers, and stakeholders to ensure that we are delivering the best possible solutions for our users.
